Our model is built from the \textit{Newtonian Burst Model} defined in section 2.1 of Loutrel and Yunes \cite{ly2017}.

The waveform is wavelets.
In order to associate disconnected wavelets we use prior.

The prior is a function of physical meta-parameters that discribe the binary orbit.

each `blob' is defined by a bivariate normal distribution, centered at $(t,f)$.
The covariance is defined by the uncertainty on the centroid location \textit{not} the time-frequency shape of the burst.

Prior knowledge of the duration or bandwidth of a burst would inform the quality factor of the wavelets.
