Gravitational waves
We are now post GW150914 \cite{GW150914}.
There are lots of \BBH~detections.
\par

Binaries are thought to circularize before entering LIGO band \CiteNeed.
Rodriguez et al. says fraction of \BBH~will have $e\gtrsim0.1$ when they enter band \CiteNeed.
Highly eccentric: dynamical capture, N-body.
\par

Eccentric waveform modeling is hard.
See recent work from Yunes group, Hinder+ 2018, Yang+ 2018... \CiteNeed
So templated searches are hard.
Existing searches with eccentric templates.
\par

Burst searches!
BayesWave \cite{cl2015}.
Targeted bursts: chirplets, cWB's BBH search \CiteNeed.
cWB's eccentric method \CiteNeed.
